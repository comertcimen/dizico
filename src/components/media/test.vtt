what's our next step?

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.084
Advance through the trocar

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:18.819
15 millimeters beyond the tip

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.921
until the opening
of the distal basket

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:22.790
can be confirmed by ultrasound.

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:28.662
Exactly.

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:30.931
What would you like me to advance,
Dr. Jackson?

00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:33.967
Oh. Yes. Right.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:37.938
OLIVIA: Obviously, you would be advancing
the double basket rocket catheter, not this.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.139
Sorry.

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:43.043
Not your fault.

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:44.745
If a junior resident
is ill-prepared,

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:46.078
that's on the senior resident.

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:55.522
How is it fair that I get blamed
for a first-year's mistake,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:56.833
and how can I help that person

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:58.525
without being unfair
to the other one?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.695
And how fair was the preferential
treatment that you gave me?

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:04.965
And how fair was it to
the other first-year resident,

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:06.818
who didn't get placed
because you helped me?

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.169
And how fair was... Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:10.302
Put the list down.

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.673
Only four questions at
a time. That's my limit.

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:15.475
What kind of mistake?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.080
Even though I went over
the procedure with Olivia,

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:23.050
she still gave
Dr. Andrews the pusher rod

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.684
when he needed
the rocket catheter,

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:26.353
and he said it was my fault.

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:27.486
It was your fault.

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.157
You got to help
her a little more.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.360
That is not fair to Jordan.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:34.804
What does fairness
have to do with it?

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.196
It's not about equality.

00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:38.832
It's about figuring out
what each person needs

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:40.868
and then teaching
them how to get it.

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:44.004
How do I know what they need?

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.974
(SIGHS) Well,
you've taught them medicine, right?

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.810

maybe it's something else.

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:51.411
Maybe it's an emotional issue.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.664
Well, then I definitely can't
give them what they need.

00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:55.749
You can ask them.

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.017
About their emotions?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.519
Yeah, ask them how they feel.

That's the beauty of it.
You don't have to care.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.426
You just have to ask
them how they really feel.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.128

First day of fifth grade,

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:25.358
when Mrs. Deloitte asked
me what 6 times 9 was,

I told the whole

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.575
I realized that if I got
the answer wrong today,

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.844
no one will laugh,
but someone may die.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.250
The kids laughed at me, too.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.455
Even though I knew
6 times 9 was 54.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.689

So, what do we do?

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.608
Laparoscopic
radiofrequency ablation.

00:16:15.742 --> 00:16:18.262
Short recovery time, but a
significant chance his cancer returns.

00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:19.345
Care to rebut?

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:25.785
I think we should consider
a hepatic lobectomy

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.320
and lymph node dissection.

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.122
Remove the affected
area of the liver,

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.658
all the surrounding tissue,
and every swollen node we find.

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.660
And that's the
aggressive approach.

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.962
Longer recovery time,
high risk of complications,

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:38.198
and, uh,

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.942
admittedly,
the best shot at beating the cancer.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.669
By "complications,"
you mean a barely functioning liver,

00:16:42.802 --> 00:16:45.004
a persistent threat of fatal bleeds,
and chronic pain.

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.606
As surgeons, you can gut him,

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.751

I have to find the balance

and quality of life.

we discover another one.

You may have left
your religion in Brooklyn,

00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:06.744
but you keep looking for
meaning in random events.

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.361

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.805
ASHER: I'm not looking for
meaning. I'm looking for patterns.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.598
Maybe he's got some
underlying condition.

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:14.234
I agree with Asher.

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.371
I get it. It hurts.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.607
You're pathetic.

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.685
You're worried about me
because I'll never be a surgeon?

00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:57.777
Boo-hoo.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.488
You're worried about me
because I took pleasure

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:00.980
in screwing with you and Claire?

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:02.114
That's who I am.

00:18:02.849 --> 00:18:04.584
The question is, who are you?

00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:06.477
You don't show up late
with lame-ass excuses,

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:08.279
and when you get dissed,
you diss back, so...

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:10.722
How are you feeling?

00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:13.325
Forget I asked.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.300
He's lost most of
his amniotic fluid.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.968
Won't last very long in utero.

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:25.205
In helping the weak,
we hurt the strong.

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:26.706
C-section?

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:29.576
If we do a C-section
to save the strong baby,

00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:31.844
there's a 90% chance
the weak baby will die.

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:35.182
But if we do an amnioinfusion
to save the weak baby,

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:38.418
there's an 85% chance
that strong baby will die.

00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:40.552
It's the better option.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.458
5% to decide which baby lives?

00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:47.527
Kenzie's body has
already made that choice.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.762
If there's a strong
baby and a weak baby,

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.240
it's pretty clear
which one we save.

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.265
Survival of the fittest.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.436
Sorry. It's just...

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.548
That's not really what we're about,
is it,

00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:01.541
as a civilization?

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:03.943
Aren't the strong morally
obligated to help the weak?

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.846
And if they don't,
isn't everybody ultimately worse off?

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.618
Neither baby has to die.

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.955
Delayed interval delivery.

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:18.625
We induce labor,
deliver the strong twin,

00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:21.027
then stop the labor to
keep the weak twin in utero

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.795
until his lungs mature.

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:25.832
The chances of stopping
labor are very slim.

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:29.602
That's true. There's about a 70%
chance that both babies would die.

00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:31.304
Which makes it the
worst possible choice.

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:32.972
We need to ask Kenzie.

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:35.074
No, we don't.

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:38.511
Once she hears there's the
slightest chance of saving both babies,

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:40.480
she won't listen
to any alternatives.

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:42.882
